\footnotetext{Pratice Link: \href{https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-ways-to-place-people-ii/}{LC3027}}

\end{problem}


\begin{solution}[starting at idx | $O(n^2)$]
    \intution{Intution: count all rectangel starting at point p1}

    This is similar to \textbf{count all subarray ending at idx and satifying certain constrain}. This time we have to count all rectangle satisfying the given constrain.

        intution exlanation in details.\\
        As you fix p1, you need to track B.y maximum for all rectangle already formed for point p1.

        check code for more details.
