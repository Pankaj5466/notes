    LC209

\begin{guide}
    Can you divise a brute force solution? \\
    Try generating all the possible substring? First try with \underline{fixing the start point \& vary the end point} then try with \underline{fixing the end point \& vary the start point}

    Brute Force has complexity of ${O(n^2)}$ can you think something by computing prefix\_sum and then binary\_search to find index or r?

    Very good task thinking of above $O(n*log(n))$ solution. Now as this is subarray problem, you must try to see if sliding window can be applied to solve this problem.
