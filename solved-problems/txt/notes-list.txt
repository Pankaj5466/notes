required/needed .cpp file are added only
required/needed .tex file are added only.
    if there is tex file, its possible visual solution clue is also added
    as tex requires more effor, it is only for hard or very hard problems, or repeatable problems.
    
difficulty level E1-E3,M4-M6,H7-H8,HH9

lc3026              solved  added       Maximum Good Subarray Sum                               ending at idx pattern.
lc3027              solved  added       Find the Number of Ways to Place People II              ad-hoc, startign at idx pattern
lc3029              solved  pending     Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State I           
lc3031              pending pending     Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State II         z-function, o(n^2) is done. O(n) is a little hard, so skipped for now.
lc3035      medium  solved  skipped     Maximum Palindromes After Operations                    Hint: count all pairs. Then try to complete the string of smallest string to palindrome first.
lc3036      hard    solved  skipped     Number of Subarrays That Match a Pattern II             Hint: convert s to pat[] array formate. Then use KMP to find pattern in s. (check KMP on algo-notes .tex)
