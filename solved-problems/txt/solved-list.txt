lc3031              pending pending     Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State II         z-function, o(n^2) is done. O(n) is a little hard, so skipped for now.

lc3036      hard    solved  skipped     Number of Subarrays That Match a Pattern II             Hint: convert s to pat[] array formate. Then use KMP to find pattern in s. (check KMP on algo-notes .tex)
