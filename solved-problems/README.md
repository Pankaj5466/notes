-> This folder is just created to keep track of all the problem solved while pratice/online save.

=> Just dumping all the solved problem into this SHOULD not be the goal!
I just want to keep track of good problems which i have encountered anywhere.

=> Along with that, we will keep a list of similar problem for practice.(ex: quickly go through the concept or submit them, if stuck just refer our note in this)
ex: striver_75.txt

=> listing all the problem in single list is not benificial, as we would not be able to relate them. Our goal after reading a problem should be from which previous solved it match closest to.

The minimal the information, the better it is to be relatable to the brain!


# How to note down the question
`noted-list.txt` <- problem you have solved and should be noted

preplist_XYZ.txt <- individual preplist which you solved during a revision/prepartion session. (ex: preplist_striver_75.txt, preplist_blind_75.txt)
    You don't need to list down all problem, just which you think which are important.

For question you want to save if its DP,or greedy etc. You can save that info in `tagged.txt` 

# How to note down the solution

L1 Solution: For medium level problem, we will just paste the leetcode solution to `x-code` folder.
    Remember the standard format for it is
    /* 
    Appraoch1:
    Appraoch2:
    ...
    */
    `code below`

L2 Solution: For problem which require .png + .cpp, we can add a .png in /tex/res folder.
and mention the .png name in cpp code approach.

L3 Solution: For problem for which even image visualization and cpp is not sufficent, we can have a .tex file.

# How to search a existing problem
use grep to search in .txt, .png, .tex

We will udpate command below as needed





After you solved a problem and want
